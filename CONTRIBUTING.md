# How to contribute

I am open to requests, bug fixes/reports and any improvements to the code, documentation etc.

* Please file bug reports and requests for new algorithms to implement to https://github.com/Koura/algorithms/issues
* Feel free to send a Pull Request for small changes, such as bug fixes or documentation changes

As this project is partly about supporting my personal learning, I will not be accepting pull requests for implementations of new algorithms. 

## Making changes

* Fork the repository on Github
* Create a new branch from main branch
* Check the official [Zig style guide](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Style-Guide)
* Make sure that the new code and the resolved issue are covered by appropriate new tests (if possible)
* Verify that all tests pass
* Push your code to your fork of the repository
* Make a Pull Request

## Commit messages

Write clear commit messages that capture the essence of the change well. Here are some tips to keep in mind:

* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
* Capitalize the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
* Wrap the body at 72 characters
* Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
